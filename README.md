Darkmatter. (2016). Multi-factor authentication is 'the solution' to hacking, says. https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/A472941438/GBIB?u=psu_main&sid=summon&xid=119a718d 

Regarding the efficacy of multi-factor authentication (MFA) in countering hacking and security threats, this source is reporting on the viewpoint of Darkmatter, a cybersecurity company. By demanding various kinds of authentication before giving access to systems, MFA is positioned as a way to improve digital security, according to the article. It emphasizes the significance of MFA in reducing a variety of cybersecurity dangers, such as password leaks and identity theft. The support of MFA by Darkmatter as a security mechanism is thoroughly examined. This source is significant because it offers perceptions on multi-factor authentication in the cybersecurity sector that are based on actual experiences. It highlights the relevance and significance of MFA as a protective mechanism against hacking and highlights the agreement among cybersecurity professionals regarding its efficacy. 

Palmer. (2022). Hackers are finding ways around multi-factor authentication. Here’s what to watch for.https://www.zdnet.com/article/hackers-are-finding-ways-around-multi-factor-authentication-heres-what-to-watch-for/  

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) in the context of cybersecurity is discussed in this article along with its difficulties and weaknesses. Although Palmer underlines that MFA is not perfect and looks at how hackers are constantly coming up with ways to get around it, it is still regarded as a strong protection against cyberattacks. The essay focuses on the necessity of constant attention in observing new threats to MFA systems and offers information about potential flaws that people and organizations should be aware of. Despite having little to do with human security, this source is important for evaluating the rapidly changing cybersecurity scene. It emphasizes the necessity of ongoing adaptation and alertness in the face of new dangers, which can be pertinent when taking into account the wider meaning of security in the digital era. 

Grimes, R. (2020). Hacking Multifactor Authentication [Review of Hacking Multifactor Authentication].https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Hacking+Multifactor+Authentication-p-9781119650805  

The article "Hacking Multifactor Authentication" by Roger A. Grimes challenges the belief in the impenetrability of MFA systems by exposing the unexpected flaws within them. Grimes highlights that no MFA solution is completely secure and goes over more than two dozen ways that MFA might be compromised. The underlying workings of MFA are shown to readers, enabling them to comprehend how these systems might be abused. The book provides advice on assessing and choosing reliable MFA solutions and is an essential tool for people and companies looking to safeguard digital assets and accounts against security threats and monetary losses. This source has value for me because I'm curious to learn about the complexities of multifactor authentication and the security issues it encounters. For researchers, professionals, and students in the field of cybersecurity,

Blockchain's potential to improve security in 6G networks is investigated in the paper "Blockchain-based Multifactor Authentication for Future 6G Cellular Networks". This assessment looks at the advantages and difficulties of integrating blockchain technology with network authentication. With the introduction of 6G networks, there is an even greater need for data security, so this source is very helpful. In the digital age, this source contributes to human security by helping those who want to strengthen the security of their cellular networks. This source is important because it discusses how important it is to protect our communications and data in the digital age. The safeguarding of confidential information is crucial given the swift progress of technology, particularly in the realm of cellular networks. This source provides a promising solution by examining how blockchain can improve security in these sophisticated networks. It offers insightful analysis of pertinent literature for people and organizations seeking to strengthen cellular network security.  

Kim, J., Lee, D., & Park, N. (2020). CCTV-RFID enabled multifactor authentication model for secure differential level video access control. Multimedia Tools and Applications, 79(31-32), 23461-23481. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-020-09016-z 

In the article "CCTV-RFID enabled multifactor authentication model for secure differential level video access control," a multifactor authentication model combining radio-frequency identification (RFID) and closed-circuit television (CCTV) technology is presented. By using a dual-pronged approach to authenticate users, the model seeks to improve security in video access control. It uses RFID to confirm identity and visual verification via CCTV. The article tackles the need for cutting-edge video security measures by combining various technologies. The reason this source is important is that it presents a multifactor authentication model that improves video access control security by merging RFID and CCTV technology. It is vital to protect this information in a time when surveillance and video data are commonplace. Video security is strengthened by the combination of RFID for identity verification and CCTV for visual verification. Wide-ranging uses for this technology include access control in safe spaces and the safeguarding of private video assets. This improves human security in the digital age. 

Baneş, V., Ravariu, C., Appasani, B., & Srinivasulu, A. (2023). A novel two-factor authentication scheme for increased security in accessing the moodle E-learning platform. Applied Sciences, 13(17), 9675. https://doi.org/10.3390/app13179675 

Their paper, "A Novel Two-Factor Authentication Scheme for Increased Security in Accessing the Moodle E-Learning Platform," presents a cutting-edge two-factor authentication mechanism. The plan is designed to improve security when using the Moodle online learning environment. The goal of this research is to improve user protection when accessing online educational resources by implementing an additional layer of authentication. The study is especially pertinent given the current state of digital education, where it is crucial to protect confidential student data. As it discusses a crucial component of the security of digital education, this research is significant. Protecting access to online learning environments such as Moodle is crucial in today's e-learning environment. Sensitive academic data and resources are safeguarded thanks to the implementation of a novel two-factor authentication system, which also improves user security. This research provides a workable way to strengthen online learning environments against possible risks and unauthorized access, which contributes to the larger cause of human security in a world where digital education is becoming more common.
